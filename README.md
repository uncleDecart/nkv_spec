# Notify Key Value Storage (nkv) Specification

This library contains specification for Notify Key Value (repo [link](https://github.com/uncleDecart/nkv)).
Also it contains golang and rust generated versions so that you can use them in your own nkv client.

Specification is written using [Cap'n Proto](https://capnproto.org/) which makes it easier to create clients
in other programming languages, Cap'n Proto supports bunch of them out of the [box](https://capnproto.org/otherlang.html).
